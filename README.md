# Shell
Simple shell implementation in C for Operating System course.

To run this project please upload shell_src directory and do "make" into that directory. 
You will also need some more files, which were dedicated to student's on Operating System Course.
Shared files have only show idea which I had writting this project and how basics operations in own shell can be implemented.
If you want to know something more, please contact with me by mail in my profile.
